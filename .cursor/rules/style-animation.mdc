# Animation and Transition Guide
## Purposeful Animations:
- Use animations to highlight key services or project showcases.
- Ensure each animation serves a clear function, avoiding unnecessary effects.
## Subtle Transitions:
- Implement smooth transitions for navigation menus and buttons to enhance user experience.
- Maintain consistency in transition styles across the site.
## Reflect Brand Identity
- Align animation styles with the company's brand and the construction industry's aesthetics.
- Utilize color schemes and motion that resonate with construction themes (use my color guide).
## Performance Optimization:
- Optimize animations to ensure they do not hinder site loading times.
- Use efficient coding practices and compress media files appropriately.
## Accessibility Considerations:
- Ensure animations do not cause distractions or discomfort.
